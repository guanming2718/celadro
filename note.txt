Modification of the source code and the python files:

A The dynamics of polarisation
A.1 The polarisation aligns to elongation axis(magnitude of poliarization is fiexd)
-parameters: align-polarization-to=2
            alpha,J-pol,D-pol
-example:shape1

A.2 The polarisation relaxes to elongation axis(both orientation and magnitude) 
-parameters: align-polarization-to=3
            beta,J-pol,D-pol
-example:shape2

A.3 Contact inhibition of locomotion
The orientation of polarisation aligns to repulsive force, the magnidue supressed expoentially
with the overlap between the cell front and other cell bodies.
-parameters: align-polarisation-to=4
            eta,alpha,J-pol,D-pol
magnitude of polarization = alpha*exp(-eta*overlap)
-example:cluster-CIL

B Polarisation distribution
B.1 The polarization of a cell is distributed at the front of a cell or 
in the whole cell.
-parameters:pol-distribution
-example:cluster-CIL

C Type of walls
According to many experiments, cells are always confined by an nonadhesive substrate at the outer
boundaries.In this region, polarizations and self-elongation are supressed.
-parameters:wall-type=nonadhesive(or hard)
-example:circular-confinement-nonadhesive

D Configurations
D.1 Cluster
The old configuration option cluster works not fine with large number of cells. To realize the
cluster configuration, we confine the cell into a elliptical wall and remove the elliptical walls 
after the relaxation steps(the walls at the simulation box remains).
-parameter:bc,rm-confine-after-relax,confinement-ratio
-example:cluster-CIL

D.2 Obstalce
A circular obstacle can be set in the domain. The size,center,type(hard or nonadhesive) and other properties of this obstacle 
can be set by this options.
-parameters:obstacle-type,obstacle-center-x,obstacle-center-y,obstacle-omega,obstacle-kappa
-example:obstacle

D.3 Load configuration from files
The initial position,polarisation,and namtic activity can be loaded from a json file
-parameters:init-config
-example:load-config

E Adhesion
E.1 To make the simulation more stable,the adhesion is modified.The laplace term is supressed and a stronger adhesion can be applied. 
-parameters:omega
-example:adhesion

F Plot
F.1 Plot the trajectories of cell centers.
-function:tractories() in plot.py 
-example:plot-center-trajectory
F.2 Plot force,velocity,shape field(and defect),Q field(and defect),polarization field,correlation lengthes
F.3 plot force density
-function:force_density() in plot.py
